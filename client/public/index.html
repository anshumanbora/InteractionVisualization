            <p>The motivation behind this visualization is that by only studying a user's activity over a period of time
                we can truly ascertain the effort an user puts into his work.

                On hovering on a particular day, we can see that count of logs made by the user on that day.

                <h4>Analysis of Patterns</h4>

                <li>
                    A cursory analysis of any of the user's timeline yields that generally the user
                    activity is sporadic and not steady over a stretch of time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is observed that if users are highly active on a particular day, they tend to remain active during the days
                    leading upto that day and the activity decreases as we move pass that day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The days when the users log maximum activity could potentially suggest important events like project deadlines.
                    Alternatively it could also suggest that they are putting in extra efforts to find solution to a tough problem.
                </li>

            </div>
            <div class="method"> <h4>Method</h4>
                To generate this graph, timestamps of user log-ins were recorded over a period of days. Then for every user
                the total number of times he/she logged into the applications is recorded, for each day days. Corresponding
                values for each date was plotted on the calendar-graph to accomplish this visualization.

                <p>It is very difficulty to determine if a user is successful in finding a solution to their problems after
                    visiting a site. The analysis of navigational data of users on a website gives another metric to measure
                    the success of the site.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="interactions"><h4>Interactions</h4>
                On hovering over a particular slice of the pie chart, we can view tha count and the percentage
                sites visited by the user.
                One can view any user's activity by selecting from a drop-down list of available users.
            </div>

            <div class="patterns"><h4>Analysis of Patterns</h4>


                <li>While searching for solutions on stackoverflow, users overwhelmingly tend to search for
                    answers within stackoverflow. This could suggest that stackoverflow has enough resources to
                    pacify the users quest for solution to their problems.
                </li>
                <li>It is seen that on an average only about a fourth of the links clicked by the users take
                    them away from stackoverflow to some other site. This might suggest that the number of links taking a user
                    outside the domain of stackoverflow are way lesser, compared to the links which take the users to
                    another section of stackoverlflow.
                </li>
                <li>It is observed that the distribution of share of links accessed might be skewed when
                    the interactions are lower, but as the user interactions increases with stackoverflow,
                    the values become stable and tend to settle in a range where 70%  of the links takes the
                    user somewhere whithin stackoverflow.

                </li>


            </div>
            <div class="method"><h4>Method</h4>
                Every time the users navigated to a different page, the urls were recorded along-with the information if
                they are moving away from or within stackoverflow. Then these recordings were visualized in the form of two
                pie-charts for a clear view of the division.

        <div class="motivation"><h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>Tags are one the most important feature which helps us in determining the interest of the user. Tags can
                explicitly help define the profile of an user by showing us the domains in which the users are working. Also
                by finding common tags accessed by the users we can find user having similar interests.

        <div class="interactions"><h4>Interactions</h4>
            On hovering over a particular data-point(tag) on the graph, we can view tha name as well as the number of times
            that tag was asscessed by all the users.
            By clicking on a data-point(tag), we can see all the users who have come across that particular tag.
        </div>

        <div class="patterns"><h4>Analysis of Patterns</h4>

            <li>It is observed that majority of the tags encountered by the users deals with concepts which
                are used in widely in real-life, for example 'javascript' which is one of the highest encountered
                tags, is a very common language.
            </li>
            <li>
                If we look at the top most tags encountered, it can be observed that they are related to each other
                , for example 'ajax' calls are frequently used in 'javascript'.
            </li>
            <li>
                The users which have similar tags associated with them are most probably working on similar projects
                or maybe they have similar interests.
            </li>


        </div>

        <div class="method"><h4>Method</h4>
            Every time the users navigated to a new page or they search for something, the tags related to that page were recorder for every user. Then
            a overall occurrence of the tags, for all users, was determined. Then these values were plotted on a scatter chart to get
            a clearer understanding of the frequencies of the tags. Also users who had previously accessed the same tags are shown.
